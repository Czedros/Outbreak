# Outbreak! (Uly 1)
A game of moral decisions involving zombies, days and nights, resources, obstacles, and action points. Will you save others, or will you save yourself?

## How to Play
Click on your human (there is only one player) and click on the available spots to move. Based on your amount of AP, you can select a certain combination of moves (moving, healing).

### Features
As more zombies are healed (and disappear off the board), more resources will be used up each turn. Move around to gather the resources to replenish your stock so you don't die.

AP dictates how much you can do per turn. It refills a little after every turn. This limits how much you can do per turn.

Day and night cycles add changes to the game.*******

Obstacles include water and houses/walls. You are unable to move onto these tiles.

You can heal orthogonally and diagonally, as shown by the shaded squares when you select the human.

## Win Scenarios
1. The human survives 50 turns without running out of food.
2. Every zombie is cured.

## Lose Scenarios
1. You run out of resources before 50 turns are over.
2. You are turned into a zombie.
